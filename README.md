# Session 3 attempt from GAI for Scholarship 

Instructions and session materials are from: [Generative AI for Scholarship - Session 3](https://astrostubbs.github.io/GenAI-for-Scholarship/session3-power-user.html)

I used Claude Code from the command line, and Anthropic models via AWS Bedrock (Model was Claude Sonnet 4.5; small fast model was Claude Haiku 4.5)

The "LSTM Neural Network" approach didn't work in my environment.  I didn't do a whole lot to troubleshoot it.  I was focusing on going through the instructions.

I would like to repeat this using Claude Opus 4.6, and also spend a bit more time understanding the work and not simply be a monkey at the keyboard.
